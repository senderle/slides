# Managing Humanities Data
--
> Humanities scholars will sometimes describe elaborate visualizations to me, 
    involving charts and graphs and change over time. “Great,” I respond. 
    “Let’s see your data.” “Data?” they say. “Oh, I don’t have any data.”...

>> --Miriam Posner, "Humanities Data, A Necessary Contradiction"
--
> When you call something data, you imply that it exists in discrete, 
    fungible units; that it is computationally tractable; that its meaningful 
    qualities can be enumerated in a finite list; that someone else performing 
    the same operations on the same data will come up with the same results. 
    This is not how humanists think of the material they work with.

Data:
- Discrete
- Computable
- Enumerable
- Replicable

How can we use data to create communities of shared knowledge and practice?

--

Humanities Data:
- Richly Structured
- Browsable
- Shareable
- Remixable
