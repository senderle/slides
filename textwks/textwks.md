### What is Text Analysis?

* A set of methods for computer-assisted analysis of texts.
* Enables researchers to analyze large corpuses of texts.
* Relevant for any discipline that uses textual data.

--

### Text as Data

>When you call something data, you imply that it exists in discrete, fungible units; that it is computationally tractable; that its meaningful qualities can be enumerated in a finite list; that someone else performing the same operations on the same data will come up with the same results.

>â€“Miriam Posner, "Humanities Data: A Necessary Contradiction"

### Google NGrams

* Collects word counts from every book Google has scanned
* Shows changes in word usage over time
* Makes mistakes when confronted with obsolete typography

--

##### Case Study:
### Melville, "Bartleby the Scrivener"

>The nature of my avocations for the last thirty years has brought me into more than ordinary contact with what would seem an interesting and somewhat singular set of men, of whom as yet nothing that I know of has ever been written:--I mean the law-copyists or scriveners.

--

##### Case Study:
### Melville, "Bartleby the Scrivener"

>Nippers, the second on my list, was a whiskered, sallow, and, upon the whole, rather piratical-looking young man of about five and twenty.  I always deemed him the victim of two evil powers--ambition and indigestion.  The ambition was evinced by a certain impatience of the duties of a mere copyist...

##### Case Study:
### Melville, "Bartleby the Scrivener"

>I remembered the bright silks and sparkling faces I had seen that day, in gala trim, swan-like sailing down the Mississippi of Broadway; and I contrasted them with the pallid copyist, and thought to myself, Ah, happiness courts the light, so we deem the world is gay; but misery hides aloof, so we deem that misery there is none.

### Topic Modeling

* Automatically identifies "topics" in a large collection of texts
* Requires no human input, apart from the number of topics to look for
* Topics can be ambiguous; metadata is required for interpretation
