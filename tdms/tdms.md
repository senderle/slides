# Text and Data Mining Services Task Group

--

### Charge

The taskforce should survey the libraryâ€™s current TDM resources and the 
means by which access is provided, including how they are licensed, how 
access is provided to the researcher, any sustainability and/or preservation 
concerns, both for the content and for access, and what form of mediation, 
if any, is required by library staff to enable that access.

--

### Deliverables

A report describing:
 * the current TDM landscape, in brief
 * the ways in which access to our TDM resources are currently provided, and suggestions for improvements.
 * a list of resources to which the library should consider providing access.
 * schemata for public-facing documentation (e.g., a Libguide) listing the 
TDM resources to which the library currently provides access.
 * internal documentation, detailing relevant particulars of licensing 
agreements and modes of access to our current TDM resources.

### Current Stage

In support of these goals, we're trying to collect as much information as 
possible about how people are using large text corpora and other datasets.
